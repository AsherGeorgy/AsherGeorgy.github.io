<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    This project provides a brief overview of the <strong>Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</strong> and its practical applications in financial analysis. It explores the implementation of CAPM using <u>Walmart Inc, Coca-Cola Co, Lockheed Martin Corp and Pfizer Inc</u> stocks as examples, demonstrating how to calculate <strong>beta values</strong> and <strong>expected returns</strong>, as well as assess <strong>risk-adjusted returns</strong> using the <strong>Sharpe Ratio</strong> with Python.
</p>
<p>
	Investors require a systematic approach to evaluate the expected returns of securities based on their risk. The CAPM serves as a foundational model in finance for understanding the relationship between risk and return, while the Sharpe Ratio helps investors assess the risk-adjusted performance of their investments. Together, these tools enable more informed investment decisions.

<h2>Approach</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Data Retrieval:</strong> Historical stock prices are fetched using the Yahoo Finance API. 
        Monthly log returns are calculated to understand stock performance over time.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Beta Calculation:</strong> The beta values for selected stocks are computed in relation to a market index, 
        indicating the sensitivity of the stock to market movements.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Expected Returns Estimation:</strong> Expected returns for each stock are calculated using the CAPM formula, 
        incorporating the risk-free rate and equity risk premium.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sharpe Ratio Calculation:</strong> The Sharpe Ratio is computed to evaluate the risk-adjusted return 
        for the selected stocks, providing insights into their performance relative to the risk taken.
    </li>
</ol>
