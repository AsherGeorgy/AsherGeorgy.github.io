<h1><u>Overview</u></h1>
<p>
    This personal website was developed to showcase my professional resume, portfolio, and contact details in an intuitive and organized manner. Initially conceived as a simple online resume page, the project expanded to a multi-page personal hub, reflecting my self-driven journey and progress in web development.
</p>

<h2><u>Development Process</u></h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Inspiration & Foundation:</strong> The project began with a basic resume template from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools.com</a>. It provided the initial structure and layout for the website.</li>
    <li><strong>Learning HTML & CSS:</strong> With no formal background in computer science, I took a self-taught approach, learning HTML and CSS through free online resources.</li>
    <li><strong>Gradual Expansion:</strong> As I gained more confidence, I added new sections, such as the portfolio and contact pages, and enhanced the user experience with better navigation, style adjustments, and embedded widgets.</li>
    <li><strong>Customization & Feedback:</strong> Generative AI tools played a significant role, providing guidance and suggestions for improvements and helping fine-tune the design.</li>
    <li><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> The website is built using HTML5, CSS3, and Font Awesome for icons. It was initially hosted locally, and was later pushed to GitHub to be hosted as a GitHub page for wider visibility.</li>
</ol>

<h2><u>Planned Future Improvements</u></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Implementing basic JavaScript for dynamic content and enhanced interactivity.</li>
    <li>Incorporating analytics to track visitor engagement and website performance.</li>
    <li>Host it independently using a custom domain.</li>
</ul>
