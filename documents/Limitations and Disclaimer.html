    <h1>Limitations and Disclaimer</h1>
</header>

<div class="container">
    <p>This document outlines the limitations and legal disclaimer for the <a href="https://optimize-this-portfolio.streamlit.app/">Portfolio Optimization Streamlit App</a>. It highlights the app's assumptions, constraints, and risks, providing a clear understanding of its capabilities and legal terms.</p>

    

    <h2>Limitations</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Reliance on Historical Data</strong>: The app uses historical price data from Yahoo Finance, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Market conditions, macroeconomic factors, and company-specific events can significantly impact future performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Assumptions</strong>: The app is based on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), which assumes normal distribution of returns, constant correlations between assets, and rational, risk-averse investorsâ€”assumptions that may not hold in real-world scenarios, especially during market volatility.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplified Risk Metrics</strong>: The app uses volatility as a measure of risk, but this does not account for tail risks, liquidity issues, or non-linear risks inherent in some assets.</li>
        <li><strong>Asset Coverage and Benchmark Dependency</strong>: Only assets with sufficient historical data are included, and performance evaluation depends on the chosen benchmark index, which must be relevant to the portfolio's composition for meaningful comparisons.</li>
        <li><strong>No Transaction Costs or Real-World Considerations</strong>: The app assumes ideal conditions without transaction costs, taxes, or fees, and it does not account for real-world factors like changes in the risk-free rate, market impact, or behavioral biases.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

    <p>This app is provided "as is" for educational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.
